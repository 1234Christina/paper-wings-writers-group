        <h2>Writing Tips</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to learn how to craft the perfect novel?
            Here you'll find some inspiring quotes from ten bestselling authors.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <p>“Read, read, read.
                    Read everything — trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who
                    works as an apprentice and studies the master.
                    Read! You'll absorb it. Then write. If it's good, you'll find out. If it's not, throw it out of the
                    window.” — William Faulkner</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>"If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it." — Toni Morrison</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Everybody walks past a thousand story ideas every day. The good writers are the ones who see five or six of them. 
                    Most people don’t see any.” — Orson Scott</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> “Ideas are cheap. It’s the execution that is all important.” — George R.R. Martin</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> “First, find out what your hero wants, then just follow him.” — Ray Bradbury</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Being a writer is a very peculiar sort of job: It’s always you versus a blank sheet of paper (or a blank screen) 
                    and quite often the blank piece of paper wins.” — Neil Gaiman</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“You can fix anything but a blank page.” — Nora Roberts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> “Abandon the idea that you are ever going to finish. Lose track of the 400 pages and write just one page for each day, it helps. 
                    Then when it gets finished, you are always surprised.” — John Steinbeck</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at the typewriter and bleed.” — Ernest Hemingway</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>“Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others.” — Virginia Woolf</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
